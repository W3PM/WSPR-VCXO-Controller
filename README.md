# WSPR-VCXO-Controller-
A WSPR controller using pulse width modulation (PWM) to derive narrow-band 4-FSK modulation from a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO).

This project provides ‘on chip’ generation of WSPR message; internal timing or NMEA GPS timing for UTC synchronization of WSPR transmissions; ‘on-the-fly’ GPS generation of grid square location for portable operation; pulse width modulation output; symbol data output; and low power consumption allowing battery operation.
